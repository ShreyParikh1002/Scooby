# Scooby
Work in progress  

You can't control what you can't measure. 
So here's an app to take back control of your time.

Scooby compels you to track your activities every hour.
A vibration only alarm rings up every hour with a 
pop up window, but procrastinators beware, this is 
no ordinary pop up. You can't do anything else on your phone 
unless this window is closed, neither can you close it untill you 
fill atleast one activity. 

But why so many constraints? ~ so that these don't get ignored
 like your hourly drink water reminders ðŸ˜‚.

Now heres the pop up
