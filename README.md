WORK IN PROGRESS

You can't control what you can't measure. 
So here's an app to take back control of your time.

Scooby compels you to track your activities every hour.
A vibration only alarm rings up every hour with a 
pop up window.
            
                       zzzzzz     zzzzzz     zzzzzz.    zzzzzz     zzzzzz     zzzzzz

 But procrastinators beware, this is 
no ordinary pop up. You can't do anything else on your phone 
unless this window is closed, neither can you close it untill you 
fill atleast one activity. Ya ya don't worry there's a special 
provision of emergency button where you can close the window without
filling it, but this can be used only twice per day.

But why so many constraints? ~ so that these don't get ignored
 like your hourly drink water reminders ðŸ˜‚.

Now heres the pop up

First field is the activity name, then the time
devoted and then the activity tag like wasted, 
productive, friends and family, etc. Click add if you 
wanna add more activities and then submit. To delete an entry
 you need to
long press on it.

Currently working on the front-end and report generation part.
